<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2> Rules </h2>

<p>
  A piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them),
  but may not cross enemy pieces, except one that it captures. A piece must move a number of squares that
  is exactly equal to the total number of pieces (black and white) on the line along which it chooses to move
  (the line of action). This line contains both the squares behind and in front of the piece that moves,
  as well as the square the piece is on. A piece may not move off the board, onto another piece of its color,
  or over an opposing piece.
</p>

<h2>Controlling Play</h2>

<p>
Press mouse on a piece to drag it to another place on the board. Release mouse to drop piece on new square.

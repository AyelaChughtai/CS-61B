LOA CS61B, Version 2.0.
</p>

<p>
This is an implementation of a version of the board game Lines of Action.
</p>
<p>
    Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
    It is played on a checkerboard with ordinary checkers pieces.
    The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly capturing an opposing piece.
    The goal of the game is to get all of the pieces into one group of pieces that are connected.
    Two pieces are connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first.
    Each move consists of moving a piece of your color horizontally, vertically,
    or diagonally onto an empty square or onto a square occupied by an opposing piece,
    which is then removed from the board.
